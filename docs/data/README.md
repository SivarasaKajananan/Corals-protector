## Introduction


### Over View
The idea of smart home exist for many years. The core idea of Smart Home is remotle controling of switches and bulbs. But we added some inovative features to the core idea
and make it more smarter.

#### Smart Bulbs

Our goal is to provide a futuristic lightning system to our loyal users. 
We have also identified smart lighting as an integral part of a smart home.
Smart lightning mainly focused on energy efficiency and remote control.
But we also provide many other futuristic features to our smart system. 
Join us to build a futuristic society with less energy waste.
Be in control from anywhere with control right in the mobile app.

#### Smart Switches

Smart switches have some features as smart bulbs. They can also controllable by remote or voice command. We can see the power usage and the charge percentage of the mobile or any other device. They are far safer than traditional switches. 

### Smart Curtain

Smart curtains more like the others they can be remotley controllable and it can semi automated.
With the environmental conditions the curtains can react. 



## Solution Architecture

## Hardware and Software Designs

### Hardwares 
 
* Arduino UNO
* Adafruit Lux Sensor
* Motion Sensor
* RGB Strips
* Wall Sockets
* NodeMCU
* DC Motor and motor controller
* Other things (Wires, resistors....)

### Software side

We going to build a Mobile application and a web page for the user to login and control the home.

#### FrontEnd Development

* HTML, CSS , Javascripts  
* Frame work -> React.js
* App Development -> Flutter

#### BackEnd Development

* Nodejs
* Frame work -> Express.js
* Database -> Mongodb

## Testing

Testing done on hardware and software, detailed + summarized results

## Detailed budget
